# Client part of a Client-Server Store Application
This program is a part of an application which works over the internet and allows for managing a small store's product database.

It is recomended to firstly setup [Server part](https://github.com/andrewromanyk/StoreServerPart) and then go on to setup this part.
## Setup
- Copy the repository
- Change the server link in file App.java (line 44) to your own (localhost\127.0.0.1 if run locally)
- Create a .jar file (you may skip this step and run the program via an IDE or manually)
- Start the program
